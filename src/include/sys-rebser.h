// This contains the struct definition for the "REBSER" struct Reb_Series.
// It is a small-ish descriptor for a series (though if the amount of data
// in the series is small enough, it is embedded into the structure itself.)
//
// Every string, block, path, etc. in Rebol has a REBSER.  The implementation
// of them is reused in many places where Rebol needs a general-purpose
// dynamically growing structure.  It is also used for fixed size structures
// which would like to participate in garbage collection.
//
// The REBSER is fixed-size, and is allocated as a "node" from a memory pool.
// That pool quickly grants and releases memory ranges that are sizeof(REBSER)
// without needing to use malloc() and free() for each individual allocation.
// These nodes can also be enumerated in the pool without needing the series
// to be tracked via a linked list or other structure.  The garbage collector
// is one example of code that performs such an enumeration.
//
// A REBSER node pointer will remain valid as long as outstanding references
// to the series exist in values visible to the GC.  On the other hand, the
// series's data pointer may be freed and reallocated to respond to the needs
// of resizing.  (In the future, it may be reallocated just as an idle task
// by the GC to reclaim or optimize space.)  Hence pointers into data in a
// managed series *must not be held onto across evaluations*, without
// special protection or accomodation.
//
//=//// NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * For the forward declarations of series subclasses, see %reb-defs.h
//
// * Because a series contains a union member that embeds a REBVAL directly,
//   `struct Reb_Value` must be fully defined before this file can compile.
//   Hence %sys-rebval.h must already be included.
//
// * For the API of operations available on REBSER types, see %sys-series.h
//
// * REBARR is a series that contains Rebol values (REBVALs).  It has many
//   concerns specific to special treatment and handling, in interaction with
//   the garbage collector as well as handling "relative vs specific" values.
//
// * Several related types (REBACT for function, REBCTX for context) are
//   actually stylized arrays.  They are laid out with special values in their
//   content (e.g. at the [0] index), or by links to other series in their
//   `->misc` field of the REBSER node.  Hence series are the basic building
//   blocks of nearly all variable-size structures in the system.

// SERIES <<HEADER>> FLAGS
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Series have two places to store bits...in the "header" and in the "info".
// The following are the SERIES_FLAG_XXX and ARRAY_FLAG_XXX etc. that are used
// in the header, while the SERIES_INFO_XXX flags will be found in the info.
//
// ** Make_Ser() takes SERIES_FLAG_XXX as a parameter, so anything that
// controls series creation should be a _FLAG_ as opposed to an _INFO_! **
//
// (Other general rules might be that bits that are to be tested or set as
// a group should be in the same flag group.  Perhaps things that don't change
// for the lifetime of the series might prefer header to the info, too?
// Such things might help with caching.)
//

#define SERIES_FLAGS_NONE \
    0 // helps locate places that want to say "no flags"


// Detect_Rebol_Pointer() uses the fact that this bit is 0 for series headers
// to discern between REBSER, REBVAL, and END.  If push comes to shove that
// could be done differently, and this bit retaken.

//
// This means a series cannot be expanded or contracted.  Values within the
// series are still writable (assuming it isn't otherwise locked).
//
// !!! Is there checking in all paths?  Do series contractions check this?
//
// One important reason for ensuring a series is fixed size is to avoid
// the possibility of the data pointer being reallocated.  This allows
// code to ignore the usual rule that it is unsafe to hold a pointer to
// a value inside the series data.
//
// !!! Strictly speaking, SERIES_FLAG_NO_RELOCATE could be different
// from fixed size... if there would be a reason to reallocate besides
// changing size (such as memory compaction).  For now, just make the two
// equivalent but let the callsite distinguish the intent.

// read-only and cannot be indexed into, e.g. with `next 'foo`.  This is
// because UTF-8 characters are encoded at variable sizes, and the series
// indexing does not support that at this time.  However, it would be nice
// if a way could be figured out to unify ANY-STRING! with ANY-WORD! somehow

//
// But leaving it alone for the moment: there is a mechanical problem that the
// specific number of bytes requested for allocating series data is not saved.
// Only the series capacity measured in elements is known.
//
// Hence this flag is marked on the node, which is enough to recreate the
// actual number of allocator bytes to release when the series is freed.  The
// memory is accurately tracked for GC decisions, and balances back to 0 at
// program end.
//

// code is more interested in the performance gained by being able to assume
// where to look for the data pointer and the length (e.g. paramlists and
// context varlists/keylists).  Passing this flag into series creation
// routines will avoid creating the shortened form.

// SERIES NODE ("REBSER") STRUCTURE DEFINITION
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// A REBSER node is the size of two REBVALs, and there are 3 basic layouts
// which can be overlaid inside the node:
//
//      Dynamic: [header [allocation tracking] info link misc]
//     Singular: [header [REBVAL cell] info link misc]
//      Pairing: [[REBVAL cell] [REBVAL cell]]
//
// `info` is not the start of a "Rebol Node" (REBNODE, e.g. either a REBSER or
// a REBVAL cell).  But in the singular case it is positioned right where
// the next cell after the embedded cell *would* be.  Hence the second byte
// in the info corresponding to VAL_TYPE() is 0, making it conform to the
// "terminating array" pattern.  To lower the risk of this implicit terminator
// being accidentally overwritten (which would corrupt link and misc), the
// bit corresponding to NODE_FLAG_CELL is clear.
//
// Singulars have widespread applications in the system, notably the
// efficient implementation of FRAME!.  They also narrow the gap in overhead
// between COMPOSE [A (B) C] vs. REDUCE ['A B 'C] such that the memory cost
// of the array is nearly the same as just having another value in the array.
//
// Pair REBSERs are allocated from the REBSER pool instead of their own to
// help exchange a common "currency" of allocation size more efficiently.
// They are planned for use in the PAIR! and MAP! datatypes, and anticipated
// to play a crucial part in the API--allowing a persistent handle for a
// GC'able REBVAL and associated "meta" value (which can be used for
// reference counting or other tracking.)
//
// Most of the time, code does not need to be concerned about distinguishing
// Pair from the Dynamic and Singular layouts--because it already knows
// which kind it has.  Only the GC needs to be concerned when marking
// and sweeping.
//
